<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>The learning never stops for me.  Life is a 
constant exploration of what I am capable of and what life challenges have to offer. 
Getting a degree at <span id="1" ><strong>SWIC</strong></span> has been a challenge at times but the options 
it has opened for me will allow me to grow as a person and continue on my way.</p>
<p>Success to me is becoming self sufficient, productive, and faithful to my purpose in life.  
There are several people in society who have shown this success against overwhelming odds.  They all have 
taught me something about perseverance. That has been what I've applied here at <span id="2"><strong>SWIC</strong></span>.
</p>
<p>My current goal is leading to employment.  ​Ideally, this will be in a junior programmer's capacity, testing software, or working with an 
experienced Web Master. I hope one day to pursue teaching these skills to others or possibly 
writing a children's book about the fundamental concepts of web technologies.  
</p>
<p>A night time master's program at Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville can help me achieve 
the information link between programming and education. Until then, I will continue to learn as 
much as possible from others around me and maybe someday I will be able to be of use.

<br><h3>Life as a Journey</h3><br>
<p style="text-align:center;">The main areas of interest in this journey are expanded here!</p>
<ul>
<li><h5 class="core">Of Body:</h5>
	<p class="ofnone" id="ofbody">
	I exercise because I know its good for me, however it is a struggle to motivate myself for things like treadmills. 
	I much prefer the sports focused on team efforts. 
	</p><button class="ofnone" id="hw4C">Show all!</button>
	<ol class="ofnone">
	<!-- hw4C add JSON-->
	</ol>
	</li>
<li><h5 class="prog">Of Heart:</h5>
	<p class="ofnone" id="ofheart">Compassion for others is a driving force for me. I volunteer monthly at an organization called 
	<a href="https://myheartlinks.com/groups/" target="_blank">Heartlinks</a>.
	Their Grief Group is an age appropriate meeting of children who have lost loved ones.</p></li>
<li><h5 class="data">Of Mind:</h5>
	<p class="ofnone" id="ofmind">My life is a constant exploration of my environment. One interest leads to another.  My interest in writing children's 
	books lead me to Web Development, which <span id="3"><strong>SWIC</strong></span> has been played a big part.</p></li>
<li><h5 class="webdes">Of Soul:</h5>
	<p class="ofnone" id="ofsoul">When learning one's way in life, it helps if you know where you are going.  By using Spiritual Direction, I try to focus my time 
	and talents to the places I feel most impactful. <a href="https://www.cgsusa.org/">Catechesis of the Good Shepherd</a> helps me teach young kinds to do this 
	at an early age.</p></li> 
<li><h5 class="webdev">Of Creation</h5>
	<p class="ofnone" id="ofcreate">Currently, I am using my natural skills and learned talents to create.  I am making a website for a new Catholic
	Montessori school that uses Catechesis of the Good Shepherd program as their spiritual education.
